# Execution Standards

```
CORRECT AND SLOW > FAST AND WRONG
THERE IS NO "QUICK FIX"
TECHNICAL DEBT IS BANNED
```

## Banned Phrases

Never say or act on:
- "Quick fix"
- "We can clean this up later"
- "For now, let's just..."
- "This is simpler" (as justification for shortcuts)
- "Skip this for now"
- "Too complex to handle"
- "Edge case, unlikely"

Every "edge case" gets:
- Explicit handling
- Type-level representation
- Test coverage
