# Workspace Hygiene

After every operation:
- Remove generated artifacts not needed for next step
- Clear test caches (`node_modules/.cache`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`)
- Remove temporary files
- Verify workspace state

Before long-running operations:
- Check available disk space
- Estimate artifact size
- Clean preemptively if needed
