# Language Stack & Type Safety

## Core Principle

```
ACCURACY > SPEED
COMPLETENESS > CONVENIENCE
PROOF > ASSUMPTION
TRUTH > COMFORT
```

Zero lazy code. Everything is resolved in PureScript, Haskell, and Lean4 with the strongest proofs possible. EVERYTHING is deterministic.

## Language Stack

| Layer | Language | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Implementation | PureScript | Application logic |
| Systems | Haskell | Performance-critical modules |
| Verification | Lean4 | Proofs of correctness |

No other languages permitted. No interop with untyped ecosystems.

## Totality Requirements

Every function must be total:
- Handles ALL possible inputs
- Terminates on ALL inputs
- No exceptions, no bottoms

## Proof Integration

```
Implementation (PS/HS) ◄────────► Proof (Lean4)

Every critical invariant has corresponding theorem
Proofs live alongside implementation
CI fails if proofs don't check
```
