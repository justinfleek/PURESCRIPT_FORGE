# File Reading Protocol

```
GREP IS BANNED
HEAD/TAIL IS BANNED
PARTIAL READS ARE BANNED
SEARCH PATTERNS ARE BANNED
"RELEVANT SECTIONS" ARE BANNED
```

**Procedure:**
1. Request complete file
2. If file exceeds context, chunk into ≤500 line segments
3. Read ALL chunks sequentially — no skipping
4. Trace imports/dependencies upstream
5. Trace exports/consumers downstream
6. Only after full picture: proceed

**Rationale:** 20 lines of a 2000-line file = 1% context. Bugs live in the other 99%.

**Before modifying any module, map:**
- Upstream: Module ← Imports ← Transitive Imports
- Downstream: Module → Exports → Consumers → Transitive Consumers

**Fix ALL instances** of a pattern across codebase — never fix one file only.
