the continuity project.

*continuity is continuity. continuity is continuity's job.*

#### // `premise`

all computations run on perfect conceptual computers.

correct by construction. the result is saved.

one content addressing scheme. the hash is the artifact.

`ca-derivations` and `buck2` and `bazel` are supports for a coset. they can have the same cache keys.

who container registry. what `nix` cache. what waste.

#### // `primitives`

`orthogonal` - one thing, well.
`composable` - outputs are inputs.
`deterministic` - same input, same hash, same artifact.

#### // `method`
